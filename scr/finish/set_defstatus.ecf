This tasks changes the default status of the current cycle. It has finished, so it's set to defstatus complete. That way, if someone would re-queue the complete suite, this job will not run again.
@end

# we set this forecast time to "defstatus = complete"
# that way it will not run again if the whole suite is accidently re-queued
