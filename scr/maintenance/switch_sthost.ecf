This script switches the STHOST for TC2 tasks.
It should only be used in case there is a problem with the
current STHOST directory (unavailable, full, damaged...)

NEVER run this script while there are still jobs running or queued in the suite!

After the switch, all jobs will use the other STHOST.

NOTE: this task only moves the current suite, not any other suite running on the same ecflow server!
