@manual
This maintenance script switches the suite to "delayed" mode. In this mode,
time and external triggers are ignored.

If a realtime suite is delayed more than e.g. 24h, other problems may arise like
LBC and OBS no longer being available.

Use this if the model needs to be re-run after the operational time window.

This task should only be triggered by setting the "DELAY" event.
That can be done manually or automatically during the initialisation of a cycle.
