@manual
This script switches the scratch on HPC (a <-> b).
It should only be used in case there is a problem with the
current scratch directory (unavailable, full, damaged...)

NEVER run this script while there are still jobs running or queued in the suite!

After the switch, all jobs will use the other scratch. This will can also be seen from the SCRATCH variable in ecflow.
