>>>>>>> 71c8b7e... Don't rename ini/ATOS after all. Small fix for hardcoded HOURRANGE
@manual
DESCRIPTION:
This task prepares the initial conditions for SURFEX from coupling files without surfex.
In a downscaling run, this is a normal procedure. In a data assimilation cycle, however, such a cold start should be avoided at all cost.

Usually, this task will be set complete automatically (by init_forecast task).
In an assimilation cycle, this task should only run in case of a COLDSTART.

Note that in an assimilation cycle, this task will do nothing if the COLDSTART variable is not set to the current date/run time.
However, if ECF_TRYNO >= 3 then it will run anyway. This should be avoided!

# Usually, this job should *never run* (except the very first day).
# Unless you are in dynamical adaptation, of course.
# If ECF_TRYNO > 2, we assume you really want it to run.
