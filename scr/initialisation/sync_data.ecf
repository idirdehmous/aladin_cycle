@manual
This task makes sure all data (clim files, constants , B matrix, binaries) are available in the working directories. With a new suite, this can take several minutes, but the next time is much faster.

In EXP mode, we do not rsync but just make links. That takes less space on scratch, but may be slower depending on where the data is located.

If it fails, first rerun /init_suite/create_hpc_paths to make sure all basic paths are correct. Then try again.

If failure persists, check whether the location of the data is correctly mounted and available.

Do not set complete!
