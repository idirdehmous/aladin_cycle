@manual
This tasks prepares the labels and date variables for the forecast.
It also checks whether we are still running in time.

Not sure how this task could fail (only ecflow_client commands). Check if the suite was restarted manually with a bad date string.

#   so we need to check: if we are in "delay" mode: if "now" is /before/ the trigger time
#   we must definitely unset the "delay" switch.
# On the other hand, if "now" is later than RUNDATE+X, we are definitely in delay.

      # NOTE: we can set "delay" automatically, but setting it off is harder
      # because jobs can be triggered in advance, so you need to turn it off in time!

# the most important part is to make sure we don't "miss" time triggers.
# if a job is triggered a bit too soon, that usually won't matter so much
#   because it will wait for the first_guess anyway.
#   And we can also have triggering by other models, which keeps us in sync as long as we stay close.

# TODO: add a "DELAY_THRESHOLD" (e.g. 6h, but more when coupling to HRES)
# FIXME: this should also depend on TRIGGER time
